How to learn SQL:
Take a course. There are a lot of online options out there, including courses by 
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql, 
https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science,
https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/about and 
https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-databases-and-sql-querying/. 
In person courses are a bit harder to find, but if you check a local university, community college or code camp you might get
lucky.Develop a SQL portfolio. Having examples of your ability to write queries on real databases is good evidence that you’re
familiar with the language. One option is to write kernels (i.e. hosted R or Python notebooks) on BigQuery datasets on Kaggle.
I’ve written a https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/sql-scavenger-hunt-handbook/?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=fcc 
to get you started. (Full disclosure: I work for Kaggle. :) https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql and https://sqlzoo.net/ also have quite a few SQL exercises.
